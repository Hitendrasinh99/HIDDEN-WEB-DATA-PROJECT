  <h2>Research Use of Web Archived Data</h2>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Major part of our communication and media production has moved from traditional print media into the digital universe. Digital content on the web is diverse and fluid; it emerges, changes and disappears every day. Such content is unique and valuable from an academic perspective, but as it disappears over time, we are losing the ability to study recent history.</p>
  <p>Web archives are now taking the responsibility to capture and preserve such content for future research. Web archives preserve vast amounts of data captured over the years, and one of the main goals now is to improve research usability of their collections.</p>
  <p>This article describes how web archives store web content and related metadata and summarizes several recent studies that have dealt with research requirements for web archived data. Based on conclusions of these studies, it suggests further actions to establish cooperation with the research community.</p>
